# About Grafana Enterprise licenses from AWS Marketplace

AWS Marketplace is a convenient place for AWS customers to buy and manage a license for Grafana Enterprise versions 8.3.0 and later.

You can deploy Grafana Enterprise in the following ways:

- Using AWS services like ECS, EKS or EC2.
- In an instance outside AWS.

In each case, you must activate the Grafana Enterprise license purchased in AWS Marketplace to take advantage of Grafana Enterprise observability features.

> To purchase a license directly from Grafana Labs or learn more about other Grafana offerings, [Contact a Grafana Labs representative](https://grafana.com/contact?about=grafana-enterprise).

## Before you begin
